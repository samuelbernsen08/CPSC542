Notes:
To run the test images at the bottom of the notebook, download the images in the "Images" folder and change the "filename" variable to the path to the specific image you want to predict.
If you run in Google Collaboratory, simply upload the files to the /content directory and only change the path names if your downloaded file doesn't match the name in the notebook.
